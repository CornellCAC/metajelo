The high-level structure of our proposed metadata package is illustrated in the Figure~\ref{fig:schema_v1} (produced by OxygenXML).

\end{figure} 
As shown, each package is structured as a record, which conceptually models a linkage between a publication and its supplementary materials.  As shown, a record has an identity (\ac{DOI}), a date created, a last modified date, and the identity (\ac{DOI}) of the research objects (papers) that are associated with the supplementary products.
Each record then can describe an unlimited number of \texttt{supplementaryProducts}.  Each product has an identifier, a description of its type, licensing information, and linkages to full metadata available elsewhere that fully describes the product.  Each \texttt{supplementaryProduct} has an associated location block, which contains information about the institutional archive at which the respective \texttt{supplementaryProduct} is located.  Finally, for each institution, the set of possible policies are listed, with a boolean designation of the applicability of a policy to the respective supplementary object.   
The full annotated schema is available for examination online at \href{https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/metajelo}{github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/metajelo}.
